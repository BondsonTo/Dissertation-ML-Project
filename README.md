# Dissertation-ML-Project
This is my Master degree data analysis dissertation project.  Models built with various machine learning alglorithms trying to validate companies ESG efforts would contribute to financial growth.

**Background**

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) became increasingly important for businesses and investors due to the growing awareness. Despite of inter-governmental efforts to promote ESG, Investors are also paying more attention to ESG performance as their investment criteria. Some viewed compliance and reporting requirement associated with ESG effort would adversely affect the company financial performances (CFP). This project aimed at investigating if ESG efforts and transformation really paid off at company level.

**Abstract**

This project investigates the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) using machine learning models. With a dataset of 3,422 companies across 26 countries, the research employs four machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks, to predict Return on Equity (ROE) based on ESG scores. The findings indicate a notable correlation between high ESG scores and improved financial performance. ESG score is comparable with company net sales to predict company ROE. Furthermore, ESG-CFP correlation is highly industry-specific with complex relationship remained unresolved. The findings support companies putting higher emphasis in ESG efforts and transformation.







**Findings**

**Company ESG performance matters in financial outcomes:** The analysis reveals that the Random Forest model outperforms other methods, achieving an adjusted R-squared of 0.4950. While ESG scores exhibit a weak positive relationship with ROE, the findings suggest that ESG performance is significant in explaining financial outcomes, particularly in specific industries. ESG effort significance is comparable to annual revenue in ROE prediction.

**ESG impact varied among industries:** The dissertation concludes that ESG scores are significant predictors of ROE, with industry-specific dynamics influencing the strength of this relationship. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of ESG's impact on financial performance across diverse sectors.
